This is a minimalist desktop kanban application.
Basic usage described in built-in "help" board.
Just start it and see ;)
For abuse of emojies install Google Noto Emoji Fonts.
on Void Linux they are known as package "noto-fonts-emoji",
search for correct package's name on your OS.

Nobene2 tested on Void and Manjaro Linux ditros, it also works on FreeBSD.
Might work on OpenBSD and maybe on MacOS and NetBSD.
Maybe only some file paths must be adjusted in nobene2.js file.

Installation.
  0) You must install Golang 1.21 and https://github.com/webview/webview_go with dependencies.

  1) $ git clone https://github.com/nobene/nobene2

  2) $ cd nobene2

  3) $ go build

     Copy "nb2" script to your path.
     Later you can adjust default font-size value to your taste in nobene2.css:50,13 .

  4) $ cd ~nobene2 && ./nobene2
     OR
     $ nb2

Pains of installation on openBSD :(
  1) Besides steps described above on OpenBSD you must do more tricks :
     a)
     # ln -s /usr/lib/libc.a /usr/lib/libdl.a 
     (it's a dirty trick, but it works).

    b)
    find in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig files : webkit2gtk-4.0.pc webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0.pc
    javascriptcoregtk-4.0.pc and from each file (or maybe from some other *.pc files as well)
     delete these flags :
     -Wl,-z,nobtcfi  -Wl,-z,wxneeded

    c)
    set property "wxallowed" to filesystems in /etc/fstab then reboot.

    d)
    $ export CGO_LDFLAGS="-lc"
    $ CGO_ENABLED=1 go build

    e) now you can copy and start via "nb2" as described above in 3) and 4).

    Features.
  Nobene2 is a kanban board.

  On startup it loads "help" board with usage information.

  You can create new board with +BoardName typed in command input field.

  Instead of pressing [ENTER] on keyboard, click on <== button after each typed command.

  You can clone board  with =BoardNewName typed in command input field.

  You can load another board with >BoardName.

  You can save current board with >> typed in command field and then by clicking <==
   or by clicking â†§ button on screen.

  You can add new card to the current board with +1 ( to 1st column ), +2 ( to 2nd column ) and so on...

  By doubleclicks on card you can switch between 3 views : gray, brown-centered and hidden.
  Card will be then shown with chosen view.

  You can edit card just by clicking on it and typing/deleting new text from it
  and then by moving pointer out of the card.

  You can delete card by typing in it ????? and then moving pointer out of the card.

  You can open/close list of all saved boards by clicking on === button
  or by clicking on top or bottom strings of menu widget.

  You can clone card with +++++ typed inside of card and then you will see in command field
  ready command like "++CardId", click on <== and card will be cloned at the bottom of column 3.
  CardId can be copied from another board, then load new target board and procedeed with ++ to clone
  card from 1st board to target board.

  You can delete current board with /delete .

  You can quit app with quit or q
  or by closing Nobene2's window (preferred exit method).

  You can adjust font size of cards with inputs =0 =1 =2 =3 =4 =5 =6 in input field.

  Nobene2 app has rightclickable context menu with handy copy and paste and emoji items.

  And of course you can drag and drop cards to new position on board.

  Every time you save board, two copies saved : BoardName and BoardName-bup.
  *-bup boards are not shown in the list, but you can load them with >BoardName-bup .
  If you save BoardName-bup, it creates BoardName-bup-bup :)
  So, you can load backup of backup and work on it too.

  Note: Nobene2 does not allow spaces in board name ( it's a feature ),
  max. length of board name is 32 symbols.
  Neither accepted board names with dashes ( it's a bug perhaps ).
  Underscores and pluses in board nmaes are allowed.

Backups.
 For backing up your works just copy entire directory "store" with all of it's content
 somewhere outside of "nobene2" directory tree.
 "store0" directory exists for having "help" board only starting pack,
 just in case you some day might discard  all your prior work and start over again from scratch.
 In such case delete all content inside "store" and copy all from "store0" to "store".
